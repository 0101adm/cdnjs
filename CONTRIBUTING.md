# Contributing to cdnjs Library

**Please read this document before contributing to cdnjs - thank you.**

## 0.Overview

[cdnjs](http://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs) is the GitHub repository mirroring all library assets on [cdnjs.cloudflare.com](http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com).

cdnjs relies on user-submitted pull requests and automatic updating to populate and update libraries. With hundreds of contributors and thousands of commits, it is very important that new libraries are added to cdnjs using the correct procedure.

Libraries that are actively-maintained on [npmjs](http://npmjs.org) can be configured to be _automatically_ update. Other libraries that are not on npmjs should be updated _manually_.

## 1. Policy, rules and guidelines

cdnjs will host any production version of any JavaScript (JS) or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) library, subject to appropriate licence permissions.

cdnjs will host JS, CSS, SWF and library image files.

Note: cdnjs does not currently serve HTML or PHP files.
