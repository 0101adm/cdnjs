Mainly choropleth maps where the color intensity relates to some value of a geographic area, but Highmaps also supports different features like lines (roads, rivers etc.) and points (cities, points of interest) and more. Highmaps comes in two flavors, either as a standalone JavaScript file, or as a plugin for Highcharts.",
