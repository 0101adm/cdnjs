The schemata against which a cdnjs `package.json` will be validated.

These schemata (may) have been copied from:

    https://github.com/exavolt/onde/tree/master/samples/schemas
    
They need to be updated to be accurate as per the current specs.

All .json files in this directory will be run against all of the
`package.json` files in the ajax/libs directory, though only one
will have to be successful: satisfying multiple schema may not 
be possible!
